**Project Description: Meeting Room Application**

The Meeting Room Application is a web-based software designed to streamline the process of managing and scheduling meeting rooms within an organization. It provides a centralized platform for employees to view the availability of meeting rooms and book rooms for specific time slots. The application aims to improve efficiency and reduce conflicts when reserving meeting spaces, ultimately enhancing overall workplace productivity and collaboration.

**Key Features:**

**Meeting Room Availability:** The application allows users to view the real-time availability of meeting rooms. Users can check room occupancy, scheduled events, and available time slots for booking.

**Room Reservation:** Employees can easily book meeting rooms for specific dates and times through a user-friendly interface.

**Meeting Details:** Users can provide essential information about the meeting, such as the meeting title, agenda, expected attendees, and any additional notes.

**Room Management:** Admin users have the ability to add, edit, or remove meeting rooms from the system. They can also define the maximum capacity and available amenities for each room.

**User Roles and Permissions**: The application supports different user roles, such as regular employees, Team Lead and administrators. Administrators have the authority to manage meeting rooms and user access rights.

**Benefits:**

**Efficient Resource Utilization:** The Meeting Room Application helps optimize meeting room usage, reducing the chances of underutilization or overbooking.

**Time Savings:** Users can quickly find available rooms and book them in a few clicks, saving time and effort in the scheduling process.

**Improved Collaboration:** Streamlined room reservations foster better communication and collaboration among team members.

The Meeting Room Application is a valuable tool for modern workplaces seeking to enhance their meeting room management processes, optimize resources, and improve overall productivity.
